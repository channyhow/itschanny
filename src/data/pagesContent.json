        "Originally from Reunion Island, my journey in the past decade has taken me across Asia and Australia, where I developed footwear, merging aesthetics with practicality. The turn of events during the pandemic brought me back to France, prompting a significant career shift towards technology.",
        "Today, I specialize as a front-end developer, crafting visually appealing and responsive applications. My toolbox includes React, TypeScript, and Sass, with a particular fondness for MUI (Material-UI) for its beauty and functionality. While I dabble in backend technologies like Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, my true passion resides in the front-end realm.",
        "I pride myself on being detail-oriented, a trait that occasionally leads me down the rabbit hole of perfectionism. Yet, it's this very attention to detail that motivates me to strive for excellence in every project I undertake. With a diverse background that spans continents and industries, I bring versatility, creativity, and a meticulous eye to every project.",
